# ThermoSolving-Software
This piece of software is designed using the Tkinter library in Python. It is meant to be a similar type software to Koretsky's ThermoSolver, but with additional functionality (http://cbee.oregonstate.edu/education/Thermosolver/). The code found here is several years old, in the meantime there have been significant changes in thermodynamics that necessitate a rewriting and revisiting of some of the functionality included in this software package.
While the current functionality of Koretsky's ThermoSolver is not out of date in accordance with the still current textbooks in most Thermodynamics 1 and 2 courses at the majority of universities, the hope is that this user interface may grow into a robust interface for solving many engineering related problems.
